# Rank.yml

```yaml
Ranks:
  # The number here is really the starting position
  # Shows the corresponding Rank
  # To show the corresponding number
  0: "0"
  10: "1"
  20: "2"
  30: "3"
  40: "4"
  50: "5"
  60: "6"
  70: "7"
  80: "8"
  90: "9"
  100: "10"
```

Rank's value on the right can not be a number based on the number of kills, it can be a string with colorful symbols.
